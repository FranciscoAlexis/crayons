# 🎨 App Support & Tips

Welcome to the support page! This app is designed to be **as simple as grabbing crayons and paper** — no layers, no complex tools, just pure drawing fun.  

Below you’ll find answers to common questions and helpful tips for getting the most out of your drawing time.

---

## ✏️ Getting Started
- Open the app and start drawing right away.
- Choose your favorite crayon color and let your imagination flow.
- There are no complicated tools — just like drawing on paper!

## 💾 Saving Your Drawings

- **Screenshots (Free Option):**  
  You can always save your drawing by taking a screenshot.  
  - On iPhone/iPad: Press the **Power + Volume Up** buttons (or **Power + Home** on older devices).  
  - The screenshot will be saved directly to your Photos app.

- **Save to Photo Library (Upgrade Option):**  
  By supporting the developer, you can unlock the ability to save drawings **directly to your photo library without the app’s interface**.  
  - This gives you a clean version of your artwork.  
  - Available as an in-app purchase.

## ⚙️ Permissions & Settings

- To save directly to your photo library, the app needs permission to access Photos.  
- If access is disabled, you can enable it by going to:  
  **Settings → [App Name] → Photos → Allow Access**  

⚠️ **Note:** Going to Settings may close the app and your current drawing could be lost. Consider taking a screenshot first.

## 🗑 Starting a New Drawing

- Tap **New Drawing - Garbage Can Icon** to begin again.  
- **Important:** Starting a new drawing will **delete your current one**. Make sure to save it first if you want to keep it.

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- Use screenshots for quick saving anytime.  
- Encourage kids to play freely — it’s safe and simple.  
- No layers or complex brushes means **less fuss, more fun**.  
- Think of it as a **digital sketchpad**: open, draw, smile.
